Face Classification using Adaptive Boosting (Viola Jones Algorithm)

Project Description: Data: present in folder "data".

Tasks performed: • Feature vector and weak classifiers: Use Harr feature. Compute the value of each Harr feature for each sample.
Each feature corresponds to a weak learner.
Determine the threshold between face samples and non-face samples for all the weak learners.
Calculate the classification error for each weak learner and draw the best ten features (before boosting) as Figure 3 in [1].

• Algorithm: Implementing the AdaboostAlgorithm (also see Table 1 in [1]).
